# Web Development Podcasts

I love listening to podcasts on web development to and from work and was talking to a friend at work who said, "You should put that on GitHub."  So, here it is. Hope to make this a good resource for people to go to when looking for quality podcasts.

If you have a podcast that you listen to that you think should be included, open an issue in the issue tracker.
